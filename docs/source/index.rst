pysequila's documentation
=========================

PySeQuiLa is a Python wrapper for SeQuiLa,
an ANSI-SQL compliant solution for efficient sequencing reads processing
and genomic intervals querying built on top of Apache Spark.
Range joins, depth of coverage and pileup computations are bread and butter
for NGS analysis but the high volume of data make them execute very slowly or even failing to compute.

For any topics not covered here please refer to `SeQuiLa documentation <http://biodatageeks.org/sequila/>`_
